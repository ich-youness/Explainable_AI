# Explainable AI


What is Explainable AI (XAI)?
Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making the decisions and predictions of machine learning models interpretable and transparent to humans. It helps bridge the gap between complex, "black-box" algorithms and stakeholders who rely on their outputs for critical decision-making.

What are LIME and SHAP?
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations):
LIME explains individual predictions by approximating the behavior of a complex model locally with a simpler, interpretable model. It helps identify which features contributed the most to a specific prediction, making it useful for debugging and understanding decision-making processes.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):
SHAP assigns each feature in a model prediction a Shapley value, derived from cooperative game theory. These values represent the contribution of each feature to the prediction. SHAP provides both global and local explanations, offering a comprehensive view of how a model uses features.

Why Use LIME and SHAP?
I chose LIME and SHAP for this project because:

Interpretability: Both tools make it easier to understand how individual features impact predictions.
Versatility: They work with a wide variety of models and data types.
Complementary Approaches: While LIME provides fast, localized explanations, SHAP offers a robust theoretical framework for feature importance, allowing for both granular and holistic insights.
These tools were essential for ensuring the transparency, trust, and reliability of the machine learning models used in this project.
